 In this exercise we placed several beacons in the world. Your task is to stear the quadrotor through each of them. 
 The order in which you pass through the beacons does not matter. Instead of flying manually we provide a simple 
 interface to specify a series of motion commands.

Below the simulation window is a python code editor where you can define the motion commands inside the plan_mission 
function. Create a list of motion commands using the following functions defined in the quadrotor.command package.

    forward(x) - move x meters forward
    backward(x) - move x meters backward
    left(x) - move x meters to the left
    right(x) - move x meters to the right
    up(x) - move x meters up
    down(x) - move x meters down
    turn_left(x) - turn x degrees to the left
    turn_right(x) - turn x degrees to the right

Afterwards add the commands to the mission using mission.add_commands(commands).

Each square of the grid has a side length of 0.5 meters. To send the quadrotor along your trajectory click on the 
play button. NOTE: All beacons have to be green before you click the check button at the bottom of the page.
